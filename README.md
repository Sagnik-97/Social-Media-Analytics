# Social-Media-Analytics

**Problem Statement:**

Social media generates vast, fast-changing data. Businesses must extract actionable insights—spotting trends, gauging sentiment, and identifying influencers—to guide marketing and engagement strategies.

**Business Problems Solved**

•  User engagement tracking – Measuring posting frequency, recent activity, and interaction patterns to understand platform usage and active contributors.

•  Content popularity analysis – Identifying posts with high likes, comments, and engagement ratios to inform content promotion strategies.

•  Audience interaction insights – Tracking which users engage with specific content via likes, comments, and follows to improve recommendations.

•  Community growth monitoring – Finding top influencers, highly followed users, and patterns of cross-user engagement to support creator programs.

•  Retention and inactivity detection – Identifying users with low or no posting/liking activity for targeted re-engagement campaigns.

•  Relationship & network analysis – Measuring interactions between followers/non-followers, including cross-likes and comments, to improve social graph algorithms.

•  Quality vs. quantity assessment – Detecting content that performs above or below average in terms of engagement to guide creators and platform optimization.

•  User behavior segmentation – Classifying users based on contribution levels (e.g., heavy likers, frequent commenters, passive users) for personalization and outreach.
